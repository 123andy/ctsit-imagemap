# AUTHORS

Andy Martin <github.com/123andy> created the imagemap plugin/hook.

The Image Map module was then converted to an External Module through contributions of code, testing, and ideas from the CTS-IT developers, the REDCap Team, and Mike Conlon, Ph.D.

We specifically want to thank our developers Marly Gotti www.marlygotti.com , Kyle Chesney kyle.chesney@ufl.edu, James Pence jrpence@ufl.edu, and Philip Chase pbc@ufl.edu for their contributions to the project. Taryn Stoffs tls@ufl.edu and Jerri Johnston j.johnston@ufl.edu provided valuable input into the design and testing of the Image Map module.

Ryan Valentine at Stanford has helped many researchers add new image maps to this library

The module has since been updated in collaboration by all authors.
