# AUTHORS

The Image Map module would not be possible without the generous contributions of code, testing, and ideas from the CTS-IT developers, the REDCap Team, and Mike Conlon, Ph.D. We would also like to acknowledge the generous support of Dr. Carl J Pepine's WARRIOR project.

We specifically want to thank our developers Kyle Chesney kyle.chesney@ufl.edu, James Pence jrpence@ufl.edu, and Philip Chase pbc@ufl.edu for their contributions to the project.  Taryn Stoffs tls@ufl.edu and Jerri Johnston j.johnston@ufl.edu provided valuable input into the design and testing of the Image Map module.
